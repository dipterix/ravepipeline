name: ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_get_progress
description: 'Check the execution progress of the pipeline. Shows which targets are
  completed, running, or pending. Must call ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_load first.
  ## When to Use After starting execution with mcp_tool_pipeline_run, to track progress.
  ## Preconditions - Pipeline execution has been started ## Best Practices - DO: Poll
  every 5 seconds until status is ''completed'' - DO: Report progress to user (e.g.,
  "Processing: 45% complete...") - DO: Confirm completion (e.g., "Analysis finished
  successfully!") - DON''T: Start pipeline and assume it completed without checking
  - DON''T: Ignore long-running operations'

    detail_level:
      type: string
      description: Level of detail for progress information. Either "summary" (overview)

    error:
      type: string
      description: Character, error message if success is FALSE
    progress:
      type: object
      description: Object with progress information. Contains a 'format' field ("structured"
        for data frame, "text" for string) and progress data. Summary shows counts
        ('skipped', 'dispatched', 'completed', 'errored', 'canceled', 'since'), details

    success:
      type: boolean
      description: Logical, whether progress information was retrieved successfully
implementation_example: |
  # Complete example:
  # The tool invokes an internal call to `ravepipeline:::mcp_tool_pipeline_get_progress`
  # From within R. While users should not execute the function directly,
  # this function has the following equivalent implementation:
  # Example using pipeline_name called "power_explorer"
  # Prepare: load, set & run pipeline
  pipe <- ravepipeline::pipeline("power_explorer")
  pipe$set_settings(project_name = "demo", subject_code = "DemoSubject")
  pipe$run(names = c("settings"), return_values = FALSE)
  # Check progress
  pipe$progress(method = "details")
  #
  #> # A tibble: 2 × 2
  #>   name          progress 
  #>   <chr>         <chr>    
  #> 1 settings_path skipped  
  #> 2 settings      completed
