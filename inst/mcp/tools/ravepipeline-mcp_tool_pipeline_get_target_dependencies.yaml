name: ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_get_target_dependencies
description: 'Get the dependency structure of pipeline targets. Returns a list mapping
  each target name to its dependencies. This is useful for understanding the computational
  graph and execution order. RAVE''s pipeline$run method automatically figures out
  which dependent targets need to be executed when you run any specific target - you
  don''t need to manually specify dependencies to run. Must call ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_load
  first. ## When to Use Need to understand target relationships, execution order,
  or which targets will run together. When planning partial pipeline execution, obtaining
  target by-products (since the dependencies are automatically evaluated, hence the
  results will be available) or debugging execution issues. ## Preconditions - Pipeline
  must be loaded: use `ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_load` first ## Best Practices
  - DO: Use this to understand what will execute when running specific targets - DO:
  Check dependencies before running expensive targets - DO: Use to explain to users
  which targets will be executed together, so you can avoid re-running the targets
  that have been already evaluated - DON''T: Manually manage dependencies (`ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_run`
  handles this automatically) - DON''T: Assume you know execution order without checking
  dependencies'

  # Complete example:
  # The tool invokes an internal call to
  # `ravepipeline:::mcp_tool_pipeline_get_target_dependencies`
  # From within R. If user asks for the implementations, here is
  # how `dependencies` from the output gets generated:
  # Prepare: load the pipeline: using one builtin module as an example
  pipe <- ravepipeline::pipeline("power_explorer")
  # Get `dependencies`: names are targets and values are the dependence -
  #   other targets that will run when evaluating this target
