name: ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_load
description: 'Load a RAVE pipeline by name. This makes the pipeline available for
  configuration and execution. Stores the pipeline instance in internal state for
  use by subsequent MCP tool calls. ## When to Use After identifying a pipeline from
  ravepipeline-mcp_tool_pipeline_list, before any other operations. ## Preconditions
  - Must know the exact pipeline name from mcp_tool_pipeline_list ## Best Practices
  - DO: Always call mcp_tool_pipeline_list first to get exact names - DO: Required
  before get_info, set_settings, or run - DON''T: Load pipelines with guessed names'

  # Direct implementation:
  # The tool invokes an internal call to `ravepipeline:::mcp_tool_pipeline_load`
  # From within R. While users should not execute the function directly,
  # this function has the following equivalent implementation:
  # Example using pipeline_name called "power_explorer"
  # Use 'pipe' variable to avoid confusion with the pipeline() function
  pipe <- ravepipeline::pipeline("power_explorer")
