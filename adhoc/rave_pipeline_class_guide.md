## Overview

RAVE (R Analysis and Visualization of iEEG) MCP tools enable AI assistants to:
- Discover and explore available analysis pipelines
- Configure pipeline parameters
- Execute analyses with proper validation
- Monitor execution progress
- Retrieve and visualize results


## Available Tools

The following MCP tools are available for RAVE pipeline operations:


## Basic Workflow Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pipeline Discovery

Discover and explore available analysis pipelines

### Pattern 2: Configure and Run

Complete workflow from configuration to execution

### Pattern 3: Iterative Analysis

Try different parameters to find optimal settings

### Pattern 4: Results Visualization

Read and visualize analysis results

## Advanced Workflows

### Multi-Pipeline Workflow

Sequential pipeline execution: Preprocessing -> Analysis -> Visualization

### Batch Processing Workflow

Analyze multiple subjects or sessions in parallel

### Error Recovery Workflow

Handle and recover from pipeline execution errors

## Safety and Validation

Critical safety guidelines for using RAVE MCP tools


## Best Practices

## Examples

### Example 1

**User Query**: I need to analyze gamma power in my iEEG data

**Expected Flow**: Discovery -> Load -> Configure -> Approve -> Execute -> Monitor -> Results

## Warnings

- Never execute dangerous operations without explicit user approval
- Always validate parameters against schema before setting
- Monitor long-running pipelines - don't assume completion
- Handle errors gracefully with clear explanations and recovery suggestions
- Start with discovery tools before assuming pipeline names or parameters
- Provide context and interpretation with results, not just raw data
